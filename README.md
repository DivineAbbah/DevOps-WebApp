Designing a CI/CD pipeline that includes the following stages:

Source code management (e.g., Git)

Automated build and unit testing

Artifact storage

Automated deployment to multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production)

Integration and end-to-end testing

Continuous monitoring and feedback loop

Use infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible) to provision the necessary infrastructure resources for your pipeline, such as virtual machines, containers, or serverless services.
Implement appropriate security measures and best practices for your CI/CD pipeline, such as secure credential management and role-based access control.
Document the design and architecture of your CI/CD pipeline, explaining the rationale behind your choices and highlighting any trade-offs made.
Provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use the CI/CD pipeline, including the necessary tools, configurations, and commands.
Evaluation Criteria: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Architecture and Design: The effectiveness of your CI/CD pipeline design in terms of scalability, flexibility, modularity, and adherence to best practices.
Automation and Efficiency: The level of automation achieved throughout the pipeline stages and the efficiency of the build, test, and deployment processes.
Infrastructure-as-Code: The proper use of infrastructure-as-code tools to provision and manage the required infrastructure resources.
Security and Compliance: The implementation of security measures and compliance with industry standards to protect the CI/CD pipeline and the deployed application.
Documentation: The clarity, completeness, and organization of your documentation, including the architecture overview, setup guide, and any additional insights or recommendations.
Submission: Please submit your assignment as a compressed file (e.g., ZIP) containing the following:

The source code of the web application.

Any configuration files, scripts, or templates required for the CI/CD pipeline.

Documentation explaining the architecture, setup instructions, and any additional details
